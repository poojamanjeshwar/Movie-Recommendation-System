Movie Recommendation System-

The main goal of this project is to recommend movies to users. We have developed a cloud-based service which uses Collaborative Filtering Technique with a neighborhood-based approach to help user in his or her decision-making process. Collaborative Filtering focuses on relationships between users and items, which means that the user is not provided recommendations only based on similar object types but also is recommended what similar users have watched. This technique not only personalizes the results further but also helps broaden the scope of the recommendations.
